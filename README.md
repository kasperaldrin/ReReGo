Representation based automatic Research in Golang

I intend to write a minimal easy-to-use agent engine to be used with LLM's and other deep models to conduct agentic (recursing, iterating) research through web search. Unlike other frameworks out there, the sole and only interest is to do just that. The agent will follow a set of standards and formats including the DER files and the ESSENCE files, both which will have datastructures in Golang, JSON and SQL, since these files may become very large they may be divided into parts, more on that later.
